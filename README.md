## Overview

### Description

This application would aim to encourage users to complete as many of their daily goals as possible, while adding a reward and social aspect to maintain consistency. The general theme will be video-games, with related art, sounds, and terminology. Users will be able to set their own tasks and record the completion, and upon completion, post their success with an optional accompanying image. The like button can be an “applaud button”, and comments likely won’t be featured to reduce opportunity for negativity. You will only be able to see others’ posts by both of you adding each other as friends. Statistics like streaks, average completion rates, and other custom trackers can be displayed on the user’s profile for additional incentives to get to work. Push notifications will be used to remind users of their set goals for the day, with potential for random encouraging messages.

### App Evaluation

- **Category: Productivity and Social**
- **Mobile: The ease of access that a smartphone provides to what normally would be a planner someone has to lug around can’t be understated, the mobility of this app benefits its usability greatly which gives users less excuses to ignore it. Smartphone specific features such as camera integration to reward success with a post for friends, and push notifications to remind users of their tasks are core features that can make this app successful.**
- **Story: The value of this app is very clear to those who already enjoy checking off their tasks for the day, and also those who need a boost to get back on track. I have many friends who could use some support in the productivity department, and a rewarding, self-managed interface to get just that would prove invaluable to them. This is a concept that will always be relevant and can be built upon in future versions of the app.**
- **Market: The market for this app is quite large, there are few poeple out there who don’t think they could be doing a little more with their day. If our concept works, and poeple stick with the app, it could greatly improve their productivity. This can especially be useful for students, or those tackling deadline-type jobs who have trouble dedicating time to a far out goal. The app can be useful to almost anyone though, as users create their own tasks. Someone could use the app solely to track their exercise and eating routine, or chores around the house that need to get done.**
- **Habit: The user could form a habit of using this app very easily based on the various reward and social features of the app, as well as the push notification integration. A user would open this app once a day to create their tasks and then probably upon each success to post about it, they may also open it to view the posts of others or review their own statistics at multiple points throughout the day. With both social media consumption aspects and game-like task creation + reward, there would be plenty of pulls to open the app.**
- **Scope: The scope is decently well formed for this app, we have a solid idea of the basic form that will be achievable with our timespan, with multiple optional features depending on how much time is left. Features like these include week planning, more advanced profile displays, tiny games as rewards for task completion, and other social interactions to be made available. Even in its simplest form, this is a compelling app concept.**
